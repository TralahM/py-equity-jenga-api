First Things First
--------------------
Generating an openSSL private/public key pair.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Since **v2** of the API, JengaHQ now requires some APIs to include signatures as a security measure.
This signatures are usually generated by signing some request fields with a private key.
In order to use JengaHQ you'll have to upload your public key to the developer console on JengaHQ after you generate your key pair.

This Library provides a CLI command to help you generate those keys.

.. note::
   The generated keys will be stored in your home directory under the *.JengaAPI/keys/* folder and this is where by default the Library looks for your private key when initiating JengaRequest Objects.

After Installation, Generate Your Keys using the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ jenga_gen_key_pair

.. note::
   Then copy the `~/.JengaApi/keys/publickey.pem` to your developer console on JengaHq.
